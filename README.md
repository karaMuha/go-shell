[CodeCrafters](https://codecrafters.io/) challenge #1: [Build your own Shell](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/shell/overview?_gl=1*1nynaxf*_ga*MTY2NDEyMzE0OS4xNzI1OTczMjQx*_ga_N8D6K4M2HE*MTcyNTk3MzI0MS4xLjAuMTcyNTk3MzI0MS4wLjAuMA..)

In this challenge I have built a terminal shell that currently supports the commands:
- echo [args] -> accepts a whitespace seperated input and prints it to the console
- exit [number] -> accepts one number as input and exits the program
- type [arg] -> check if the provided arg is a command supported by the shell
- pwd -> print current working directory
- cd [arg] -> accepts a path as input change working directory
